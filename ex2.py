# python以#开头代表备注，不会被程序读取运行
# A comment,this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ingored by python
print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored
# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print ("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")
